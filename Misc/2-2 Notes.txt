PAST WEEK
- took a lot of time to think of improvements i could make to the structure and design of it, and make sure my proposal was clear
- took some time to set up github repo and get re-acquainted with that since I haven't used it in a while, got it ready on both my desktop and laptop so I'd be ready to work on it in-person
- made some small progress on the project itself, but i've been stuck on a bug

IN CLASS
- work out the bug i've been stuck on
	- get multiple languages working at a time

THIS WEEK
- reach a point where I can stress test my bot with several languages at a time


Implement a loop to convert a message to a list of languages. If done, work on sending translations to unique language channels.
