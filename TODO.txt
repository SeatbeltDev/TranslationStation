--- FROM MOST TO LEAST IMPORTANT ---


fix data.csv saving in user file rather than this directory

fix chinese-simplified lang channel
	can't have parens in discord channel names
	maybe modify to remove dash and add parens?
	check for other paren lang names in googletrans
	*addlang zh-ch adds the channel only to general cat, rlang does nothing

add MORE possible langs manually (any way to automate getting the flag emoji?)

? got server hosting, but only runs stuff on original server, regardless of server command sent



clean up *rlang

transfer reactions betweens langs

add multiple langs/categories at a time



multithreading?

restructure commands so *asdfasdf for test account says 'invalid' instead of 'you do not have permission'

add support for pirate speak

--- KNOWN ISSUES ---

the bot is single-threaded, i.e. it can only translate one message at a time. other messages, even in other categories, must wait in line if a message is currently being translated. I don't know of a way to speed this up



--- COMPLETED TASKS BELOW ---

REPLACED WITH EMBEDS
webhook/clean messages
	had a test webhook message working
	implemented to translated msgs, it spammed, now webhooks don't work

fix active langs not loading up properly on first startup

check permissions for adding/removing langs and making categories

change admin check to generic admin permissions
