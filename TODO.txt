fix active langs not loading up properly on first startup

	can't have parens in discord channel names
	maybe modify to remove dash and add parens?
	check for other paren lang names in googletrans
	*addlang zh-ch adds the channel only to general cat, rlang does nothing

add more possible langs



clean up *rlang

transfer emojis betweens langs

add multiple langs/categories at a time

	had a test webhook message working

restructure commands so *asdfasdf for test account says 'invalid' instead of 'you do not have permission'


--- KNOWN ISSUES ---

the bot is single-threaded, i.e. it can only translate one message at a time. other messages, even in other categories, must wait in line if a message is currently being translated. I don't know of a way to speed this up



--- COMPLETED TASKS BELOW ---

check permissions for adding/removing langs and making categories

change admin check to generic admin permissions
